					<p>This amazing website was created for an amazing course COMP 4130 at BCIT, working under the most amazing instructor Khurram Shehzad. Our amazing team includes four talented members who are: The Amazing Marco Tjokro, The Amazing Lorenzo de Sequera, The Amazing Jun Jung and The Most Amazing Anatolii Hordiienko. Our amazing team comes together every day during the reading break to finish this amazing project on time. So The Amazing Marco was responsible for the search function, with his amazing skills he was able to make it within one day. Another member of our amazing team was The Amazing Lorenzo de Sequera, he took care of the Navigation part of our amazing website. Also, we had The Amazing Jun Jung who was responsible for Site Design of this amazingly beautiful website. Last but not least was obviously The Most Amazing Anatolii Hordiienko, who was responsible for this beautiful About Us page. The hardest part of doing this amazing final project for our team was dealing with PHP especially to filter all of those amazing paintings.  However, by working as a team and helping each other with this hard task we were able to overcome this issue. As you can see our About Us page was written with love and by saying that we mean that we expect <strong>full marks</strong> for this Amazing Page. Thank you.</p>

					<p>To give you a better understanding of what our team are we want to share with you guys our hoobies. This is very important part for you guys to read it as our Amazing Store want to be close to our customers to give you the best experience you could've possibly get. Despite of coding (as you already can tell we all very good in this field) We as an Amazing Team love to spend time together. Anatolii Hordiienko has his spacious mansion in Downtown so we all coming to his place to read some books and play dominos together. We also like to play some intellectual games such as Sudoku, Chess and Crosswords. Also, video games play a very important part in our lives. <strong>We don't like to play games in which you don't have to be smart such as: Apex, Overwatch, Fortnite and we hate people who play those kind of games.</strong> We love getting together and play mind games such as Daily Puzzles 2, Elevate - Brain Training, Word Search Puzzles and of course Hangman.</p>
